# About

This repo contains tools for deploying a plant monitoring system for the Liverpool Museum of Natural History. The code allows the museum to monitor the health of the plants over time and alerts the gardeners when there is a problem. Live data of the last 24 hours is uploaded to an RDS, while summary data of each day is stored long-term in an S3 bucket. Streamlit is used to host dashboards with visualisations displaying data about the plants' health.
